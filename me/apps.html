            <p>A bit of prehistory. After my catastrophic fail to install Monterey on my 10.1, I went full-into customization. Customizing every bit and byte of my Mac with every single app I could find. The menubar was overflowing, the dock was at it's worst, there were always at least 10 apps running...</p>
            <p>And then something changed. After over-customizing, I fell in love with the default look. The plain 'vanilla'. Now, looking back, I'm not surprized about over-customizing, since Catalina really looked that awful...</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Just less then a moth ago, however, I began expandng the MacOS experience with apps that weren't there by default.</p>
