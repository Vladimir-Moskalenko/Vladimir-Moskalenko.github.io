    <p>That's your New Year's gift, but it's kinda like getting clothes on Christmas!</p>
    <p>Year is an app created for the sake of journaling. You're too lazy to download apps like Day One? This is the ultimate solution!</p>
    <p>You're able to write a new note every day, and you'll be able to review them, too! (coming in a later version ðŸ˜‰)</p>
