Code for my website. Nothing interesting for you here.

## What's here?

### AppL
AppL, a place to download my projects, is located here. The installer for the app is located in `~/Files/Installers/AppL.pkg`

### Other apps
Also in `~/Files/Installers`, the installers for all of my other apps, such as iDea, TinyWeb, MenuWeb, ...

### Website
100% of the website was ~coded~ created by me using HTML and CSS.

## How to create installers?
It's very easy! Just get [this](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f6ec9d5fcede43d4b2a6079dd71fe057) shortcut I developed for MacOS and follow the instructions!
