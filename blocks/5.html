            <p>What do people do when they're bored? Some paint, some chillax, others play sports. Whenever I get some ideas, I code. Sadly, this doesn't always happen. Introducing... the 1-week (on Linux) challenge! To make everything less boring!</p>

            <p>What is it?</p>
            <p>The 1-week Linux challenge is simply changing operating systems for a week. Try to survive as long as you can!</p>
            <p>Rules?</p>
            <p>1. MUST use a certain OS for a week. Or else (nothing will happen...)</p>
            <p>2. Can switch to macOS (or quit the challenge) ONLY if:</p>
            <p>    - Critical error</p>
            <p>    - At least 5 incidents of issues listed in #3</p>
            <p>3. Can switch to macOS (no longer than for 1 hour, max 5 times) ONLY if:</p>
            <p>    - A certain feature is unavailable on Linux</p>
            <p>    - To reset firmware (e.g. TouchBar or Apple Thunderbolt Display)</p>
            <p>    - Need to transfer files/passwords</p>

            <p>The OG challenge</p>
            <p>TLC 1.0 went pretty good. I survived on Ubuntu. It was, however, kind of hard to get used to the wierd mouse mechanics and the fact that the touchbar wasn't working part of the time</p>
            <p>When I came back to macOS, I realized Ubuntu wasn't really much harder or impossible to live with than macOS. Of course, it does require some setup, but after that it's a pretty stable OS. For me, most of it was made by the T2Linux team, big shout-out to them for making it possible!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="textbox" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; width: 80%">
            <p>TLC 2.0</p>
            <p>Yes, I'm doing it again. After the failed 1.1, where Ubuntu literally self-destroyed, and after the quitted 1.2, where Fedora bugged, I'm more-or-less stable.</p>
            <p>What distro? Linux Mint. The linux that once wiped my whole drive (was a bit more complicated irl) seems to be extremely stable. I managed to set it up so it looks nice and like macOS, made a custom menubar (!!), set up some useful shorcuts. This time, it's very useful, and I'm afraid...</p>
            <p>Day 1: Setup. It's so much harder than Ubuntu. Nothing works, windows are wierd</p>
            <p>Day 2: Some more setup and usage. Setup still a bit frustrating, as well as the limitations of T2Linux. Why won't the Apple Thunderbolt display work? Why is there this wierd reboot loop whem trying to suspend the computer? Why??? Will need to get used to this :(</p>
            <p>Day 3: But akshually.. After getting used to some things, like manually changing light and dark mode in the OS and Firefox, it's useable. Still, would be better if I didn't have to do that, but ok, we'll live with it.</p>
            <p>Day 5: Just wrote this article. VS code isn't as nice here (e.g. why white titlebar?), but everything is looking pretty great. I'm afraid imma get so used to this that I won't wanna switch back. For real this time. Got used to all the rough bumps on the road, and everything is back normal. Productivity as much as on my Mac, only miss iCloud integration a bit.</p>
