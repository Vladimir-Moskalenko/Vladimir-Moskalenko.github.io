            <p>So today, July 29 2024 Apple played a wild card. They released iOS 18.1 db 1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1 DB 1 even before the official public OS releases. Why? My bets are on Mark Gurman who, just a day before, announced Apple Intelligence is coming in the .1 releases. And since that was true, Apple decided not to let us down and released the .1 releases as early as possible</p>
            <p>As soon as I heard this, I rushed to settings. Of course, the update wasn't there. After wasting 1 millisecond, i checked the beta channels setting and yep, 15.1 beta was there! I was really nervous that time, but, as expected, my Mac doesn't support ï£¿I. And apparently it also didn't see the update, also sad. What I did manage to do is to get it working on my mom's iPad Air M1, and here're some first thoughts.</p>

        <div class="textbox" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; width: 91%">
            <p>1. The new siri animation is fire. Really. It's just so good</p>
            <p>2. Writing tools. Don't work as good, but it's understandable: just the first beta. Can't replace typed text, generation is kinda slow (but it's an iPad... what did I expect)</p>
            <p>3. Siri. Siri did improve significantly: her speech is fluid, can remember what I said previously. But in other ways, she's still somewhat dumb. I asked her "how does tommorow look like" and she couldnt answer.</p>
            <p>4. Just iPad? Yes, for now I just tested this on an iPad, in the developer beta. I believe it'll be way better and more useful on a Mac. But I don't have a supported one yet. I wont ask for anything. for now. from you.</p>
