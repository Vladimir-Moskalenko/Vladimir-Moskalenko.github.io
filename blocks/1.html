            <p>This one is gonna be a long one. And a boring one. It's not that much more interesting for me, i'm doing it... for science. I mean, that's just good science, right? Well, let the story begin!</p>
            <p>My first Mac: 13" MacBook Air 2013. Originally, it was my mom's MBA, and I used it for some learning. For just a little bit. She would give it to us (my sister and me) for some Khan Academy, for typing an essay, and would also share her iPad 2 when it came to iPad learning apps. Back in that day, around 3d grade, I wasn't computer-geeky. at all.</p>
            <p>My oldest Mac: 15" MacBook Pro 2012. Then, around 5th grade, we would register for some online classes through our charter school (CWCS, later CWEB). Problem was that my sister and I would attend them at the same time. And that was when my dad gave me his old MBP10,1; he has bought a new MacBook Pro, the 15" 2017. I used it, once again for learning, a bit of Scratch games, and some more stuff including chess and basic coding.</p>
            <p>Google Chrome era. Since then, I used chrome for basically everything, and one of the key things in Chrome that I loved was themes. I would theme for quite a long time. And when further on we registered on a private course platform, where I would share my screen with my whole family, this was key. Problem was my sister also liked theming, so we had a war of themes: my green theme vs her turquoise theme. That was just childish play, prepping me to what would come next.</p>
            <p>Office Suite era. In the beginning of 2021, I learned about Office Suites. That was the start of the next, suddenly hardcore (for that time) era. After using OpenOffice, then LibreOffice, then MS Office, then a bunch of others, I fell in love with Calligra, KDE's office suite. Installing was a pain since it involved the terminal. I didn't have sudo perms back then, and didn't know anything about that. So, I settled in, sadly, with LibreOffice. But that wasn't the end...</p>
            <p>McIntoshed. No, not the og name of the McInBlock, but as I will now call it, I got randomly McIntoshed. And I am up to this day. It all started when I was looking for a random office suite that said "Compatible with macOS High Sierra – Big Sur." I instantly supposed Big Sur was a new macOS release, checked the system updates, nothing was present. "Oh, a mere older release, lol" I thought. After meeting it one more time, I did what would change my life forever. I googled "macOS Big Sur". And I got McIntoshed. I fell in love with Big Sur</p>
            <p>Patching, the beginning: After several days, I got the Big Sur installer. Running it would result in "Your Mac is not supported". I was depressed and in panic. Then, I found one of dosdude1's Big Sur patchers, his second-to-last one. I got to the step where it asked for an admin password, and... got stuck for a week. I simply couldn't understand why it rejected my password. However, I still managed to patch my computer, once again, this happened out of the blue. This saved me and put me in an even more complex situation.</p>
            <p>Hardcore mode: OCLP. I did know quite a lot about computers at that moment, I already knew about MrMacintosh, and knew I needed to somehow change my BoardID in order for the installer to recognize my model. OCLP is exactly the tool that did it. After some unsuccessful attempts of trying to make a bootable installer, I wiped a 1 TB drive with video recordings, and created it. (I did figure out that I'm not a sudoer, so I did it in the admin account). What was next? Next was a night I've got mixed feelings about. Both regret, happines, wishing it would never happen and wishes to go back there.</p>
            <p>July 8, 2021. Unlike a symbolic Friday the 13th, the night of July 7 – July 8 wasn't special. Other than the fact that I woke up at 3 am. And began patching. After everything successful, I got to the part that was most nervous: waiting for the installation to complete. I couldn't control it, and I just had to wait for 1.5 hours. I went to sleep, quickly woke up, hid my computers with his fans full-blast, rehid it, closed the lid. After hiding it once more, not to wake up my whole family, I opened the display. It turned on, and a chill went through my spine. That was the most nervous, depressing, scary minute of my life. A prohibited icon displayed. </p>
            <p>How it all failed. After the prohibited icon, I realized I didn't boot through OpenCore, and when I did, I was greeted with Monterey. The single most joyous minute of my life. But not for long. At night, I didn't want to burn my eyes, so I decreased the brightness, and now I couldn't change. It's now that I know I didn't install the post-install root patches, but then I was genuily scared. At least not as scared as bricking my mac, but was quite afraid. After a week (!), my parents found out, and went to the repair, where the repair guy (like 3 times older than me) didn't know about Monterey, supposed it was a problem with the beta, and my dad reinstalled Catalina.</p>
            <p>The <s>good</s> winter times. Customization was what I did during the next year, up until next summer. I promised myself not to patch anything ever agian, up until next summer. And to make the Catalina experience nicer, I decided to customize it. CDock, menu bar tools (including my own, precisely at that time did I create the OG versions of my masterpieces TinyWeb, MenuWeb, MenuText - now iDea), Vivaldi, and more. I customized, learned about macs, studied school subjects, etc. And it wasn't until summer 2022 I realized... the default look is nice. After that, I stopped.</p>
            <p>Patching++. After learning on my previous mistakes, I was all fired up for 2022. Around 1-2 months befor WWDC, I already was running on Monterey, WITH patches installed. This time, I spared the 1 TB disk, and instead used custom spoof models to let the OS update itself. Not just that, but I also started a giant project on installing every single major macOS version supported, which I almost finished. macOS Ventura didn't fully support my patcher, so I waited until beta 4?, where I successfuly installed it on my Mac, of course, after like 10 faliures. Everything was nice and fine, other than Ventura being unstable. After around 4 reinstalls, I decided to keep Ventura side-by-side, and use Monterey as my main driver.</p>
            <p>RIP. Yes, that Mac did die. But, happily it started a new era for me. So, on March 13 2023, I rebooted into Ventura for the sake of making an icon for my app in... freeform. I didn't bother to reboot, so I kept Ventura booted. I also read a physics book, a pdf with around 300 pages in it. And suddenly everything froze, right in front of my dad's eyes. Which is a good thing, 'cause I can't blame myself for that. I force rebooted it, and it instantly shut itself down. I force rebooted it again, and got into recovery, which also shut down. That was the last day of normally using it. RIP. He was a good computer, I've got thousands of memories of him. But it was time to move on, to a better, brighter future. The transition wasn't as smooth, but it was bright.</p>
            <p>The transition. So, I had some finals going on soon, and I needed to prep. While he was dead, while my dad and I were trying to resurrect him, my dad gave me his 2017 MacBook Pro. I used it for a while, and my dad ordered me, from backmarket.com, a refurbed 13" Macbook Pro from 2017.</p>
            <p>14.2. I've never used a 13" MacBook pro before, and barely ever used a mac that small. My first reaction? Wow, he's tiny! My second? He's also kinda fast. Exactly, he was tiny and fast, this is what I have in my memory now. His history was way shorter, but not less memorable. I managed to patch Sonoma on the first day with OCLP, everything but Wi-fi and bluetooth worked. I uninstalled Sonoma literally next day 'cause it was unusable. The next beta I got was beta 5, prior betas didn't detect the MBP's SSD format. I ran Sonoma for a long time, until I understood that all the new features were nice, but not like I can't live without them. On November 2, 2023, when prepping for a bio exam in College, I discovered that the built-in camera wasn't working. After a month of waiting, my new Mac arrived</p>
            <p>Modern days. On January 2, 2024, I got this cutie. This is my current MacBook Pro: the 2020 intel version. He got updated to Sonoma pretty much first-day, and I used him for everything. I have installed Windows, downgraded the macOS version, clean-installed macOS, even installed Linux – 2 times! Now, he's running macOS Sequoia... what other adventures will he experience? </p>
