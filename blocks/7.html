            <p>For the last 10 days. Yes, exactly ten days, I've been using Ubuntu only. Since the last Linux Challenge, quite a lot has changed.</p>
            <p>First, I grew closer to macOS, since I really, really loved the wallpaper. Now this may seem wierd, but the wallpaper measn a lot to me.</p>
            <p>Not just that, but I also installed Windows, which I really hate. I did that for the primary reason of running apps fast, but at the end I just didn't use it.</p>
            <p>And finally, I decided to be a part of the Ubuntu wallpaper challenge (which ended today). Go look up the results yourself ;)</p>
            <p>Now, to the experience</p>
        </div>

        <div class="textbox" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; width: 91%">
            <p>The experience this time was literally NOT rough. It was quite the opposite: everything went just as planned. Well, mostly</p>
            <p>The first issue was, you guessed it (if you read previous blocks), Apple TB display support. But I got more-or-less used to having the adapter in my computer all the time, wasn't a big problem later on</p>
            <p>The second one was Nautilus uninstalling itself and breaking the OS after a reboot. A reinstall of Ubuntu solved that</p>
            <p>Now this one's big. The third problem was a kidney infection I got. It put me into a very depressed state, but "Nobody gonna slow me do-own, oh no, I gotcha keep on 'movin!"</p>

            <p>For the first time: What macOS lacks</p>
            <p>This time, unlike previous times when I was fighting for my life, I actually was pretty chill with Ubuntu. And not that chill with macOS now that I started using it again.</p>
            <p>Here's a list of what macOS would have to become the best OS</p>
            <p>1. Updates without reboot. Yes, macOS updates are good, but still not as great as Linux's, where you can update without rebooting, and the reboot (to apply them) takes like 5 seconds</p>
            <p>2. Built-in package managers. I really got used to apt, and feel that is what macOS lacks. Homebrew is an alternative, but, once again, it requires manual setup</p>
            <p>3. Acceleration control. Pointer acceleration is what is very frustrating at times. Being able to control the acceleration would make macOS feel better</p>
            <p>4. One-click Launchpad. On Ubuntu, press the super (I remapped it to left-ctrl) key twice to view all apps. I'm on a touchbar Mac, so there isn't any Launchpad button by default, and extra trackpad gestures take up more time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; width: 91%">
            <p>What's next?</p>
            <p>I'll keep dual-booting macOS and Linux, in case I will want to start another challenge. What linux distro? One of the three: Ubuntu, Fedora, Vanilla OS (when better support for T2 macs comes). In the very rare case ZorinOS gains built-in support for T2 Macs, I'll be happy to try it out!</p>
