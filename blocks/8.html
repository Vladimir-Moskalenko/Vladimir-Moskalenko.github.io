            <p>So here we are, school and college just started, my other classes didn't though, which does free me some time. Lately, I've been busy just chillaxing. But now it's time for some fun :)</p>
            <p>Introducing... Project LicK - an attempt to make modern macOS look nice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="textbox" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; width: 91%">
            <p><b>LicK?</b></p>
            <p>"We made the buttons on the screen look so good you'll want to lick them." - Steve Jobs</p>
            <p>And truly, he did. Moreover, for more than the next decade, Apple's UIs were just like that. Apparently, Tim Cook didn't entirely agree with Steve Jobs, and flattende down the UI in iOS 7, and later in OS X Yosemite.</p>
            <p>People didn't like that UI, or, rather, they got bored of it. One of these people was me, and on one day, I discovered AquaLickX - a project by The One and Only MacOS Customizer Allan Nyholm!</p>
            <p>This project originally was written for High Sierra (?), then ported to Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey. The latest supported version was Sonoma, that's what I'm going to use for the base OS</p>
            <p>Why a project? Because I'm planning on doing way more, including customizing as much app icons as possible, and even writing an auto-install shell script. And since I may want to switch back to the default OS style, I'm going to make a separate partition and, if everything goes well, may even share a bootable iso!</p>

            <p><b>The Plan</b> (and current progress)</p>
            <p>☑ Backups for safety</p>
            <p>◻ Create a LicK partition (not an APFS volume, because I want to keep my current install safe and sound)</p>
            <p>◻ Install macOS Sonoma (+ bootable installer)</p>
            <p>◻ AquaLickX (14.5 edition)</p>
            <p>◻ Custom app icons!</p>
            <p>◻ More editing of system icons</p>
            <p>◻ .sh file – so it's easier to do stuff after updates, plus so you could do the same!</p>
