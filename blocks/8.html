            <p>Update: the original creator of AquaLickX, discontinued it, the last version having support for Sequoia - he switched to a publicly unreleased theming engine. While I could continue LicK, I myself am too busy with school to continue this project.</p>
            <p>LicK is unsupported. Maybe we'll meet again!</p>

        <div class="textbox" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; width: 91%">
            <p>So here we are, school and college just started, my other classes didn't though, which does free me some time (edit: all my classes started ;-;).</p>
            <p>Introducing... Project LicK - an attempt to make modern macOS look nice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="textbox" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; width: 91%">
            <p><b>LicK?</b></p>
            <p>"We made the buttons on the screen look so good you'll want to lick them." - Steve Jobs</p>
            <p>And truly, he did. Moreover, for more than the next decade, Apple's UIs were just like that. Apparently, Tim Cook didn't entirely agree with Steve Jobs, and flattende down the UI in iOS 7, and later in OS X Yosemite.</p>
            <p>People didn't like that UI, or, rather, they got bored of it. One of these people was me, and on one day, I discovered AquaLickX - a project by The One and Only MacOS Customizer Allan Nyholm!</p>
            <p>This project originally was written for High Sierra (?), then ported to Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey. The latest supported version was Sonoma, that's what I'm going to use for the base OS</p>
            <p>Now that's cool, but I decided to take this to the next level. Instead of manually doing all the installation, a .sh file will do all that - plus more! It will automatically get and install the theme, fetch some matching wallpapers, and even (still working on it) automatically edit icons!</p>

            <p><b>Tutorial</b> (WIP)</p>
            <p>First, you'll need to disable SIP. Follow my youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg7RJDiVeds&list=PL5eaekhmiu-2Ul50akAzKgaycOrSsPYw4&index=2">tutorial</a> on how to do that. NOTICE: disabling this will SIGNIFICANTLY reduce your safety. So make sure you've got a backup of all your data and an antivirus installed. Of course, I didn't do that. Cuz who needs an antivirus?</p>
            <p>Now, download <a href = "Files/8/install.sh">this .sh file</a>. It's the file that will do everything for you :D</p>
            <p>Open Terminal and type: </p>
            <p>cd ~/Downloads</p>
            <p>chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sg</p>
            <p>Done! Now, follow the instructions from the installer. Quick note: when asked to enter your disk #s# value, choose the one with [yourdrivename], NOT [yourdrivename] - Data.</p>
            <p>After installation, reboot your computer, and welcome to the nice OS XIV!</p>
            <p>For even more customization, you can check out cDock - ten dollars will let you customize your computer's Dock. It does come with a 7-day free trial, but I'm pretty sure you can just uninstall it after you customized the dock. I actually don't have ten dollars (https://buymeacoffee.com/vladimir.moskalenko if you've got some :D), so I'm running on the trial right now.</p>

            <p><b>The Plan</b> (and current progress)</p>
            <p>êÑÇ (who needs backups?) Backups for safety</p>
            <p>‚òë Create a LicK partition (not an APFS volume, because I want to keep my current install safe and sound)</p>
            <p>‚òë Install macOS Sonoma (+ bootable installer)</p>
            <p>‚òë AquaLickX (14.5 edition)</p>
            <p>‚òë Custom app icons!</p>
            <p>‚òë More editing of system icons</p>
            <p>‚òë cDock (or alternative)</p>
            <p>‚òë .sh file ‚Äì so it's easier to do stuff after updates, plus so you could do the same!</p>
            <p>‚òë Create a tutorial and edit this page!</p>
