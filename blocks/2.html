            <p>On WWDC24, Apple introduced the latest macOS version – Sequoia. How good is it? let's find out!</p>

        <div class="textbox" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            <p><b>Best features, as for me:</b></p>
            <p>    1. Apple Intelligence. AI promises to make the overall experience better, but I don't have a lot to say. I'm on intel, which, of course, isn't supported, and I will come only this fall in beta, long wait.</p>
            <p>    2. Notes. This one is big (kinda). Collapsible sections – great! Math notes – great, but more practical on iPad, and near-useless for me until they add Calculus support</p>
            <p>    3. Window Snapping. A lot of people will say Mac got it too late, but I've got a counter. A window snapping license by IBM (Windows got it thru a partnership) expired recently and didn't let Apple implement the feature earlier.</p>
            <p>    4. Passwords. Apple, as always, may take a while to implement something. But when it's implemented, it's the best of it's class. Like Passwords, having literally everything you may need, even 2FA built-in! And it's iCloud-supported too!</p>
            <p>    5. Other features. Tips got an update, iPhone mirroring is on the Mac (I dont have a phone tho...)</p>

            <p><b>What didn't work for me...</b></p>
            <p>    1. Apple Intelligence. I'm on an unsupported model, and thus won't experience the new Siri, even the UI >:c. More about this in article #3</p>
            <p>    2. Wallpaper, kinda... I feel the default wallpaper was made in I colors, but also, it feels a bit unnatural. Very different from the reality; imma change that >:D. More on that in article #4</p>
            <p>    3. Math Notes. I really love this feature on iPad, however iPads nowadays have giant screens. It would feel way better for that to be on an iPad mini, which I don't have. On mac, it's extremely limited. It's useful for only writing functions without Python.</p>
            <p>    4. β. Sequoia is still in beta, and still has some bugs. Like websites not loading in Safari, wallpapers not switching to dark mode, etc.</p>
            <p>    5. Safari Highlights. The great AI summarizing feature available on intel. Works flawlessly, when it works. IRL, worked just for Wikipedia, a plain-texed page with not a lot of text. Hope this will get fixed, please apple!</p>
